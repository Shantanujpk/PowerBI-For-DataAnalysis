In this chapter we will be learning,

1) Import data in powerBI
2) To Load it directly or not - If the data is clean it can be directly loaded in the powerBI or else transform it
	In this case we have imported the data from Excel file (single file)
3) In this chapter we will be transforming it using power query 
	- Will replace values using replace function in power query 

In Conclusion we learned simple ETL

E - Extracted from excel
T - Transformed it in the power query (In this case replaced wrong values with correct value)(Here we have used advanced option - Match entire cell content)
L - Loaded the transformed value in the PowerBI

Once the use of powerQury is done, close it by using apply and close 


Important : 

Difference between Import and Direct Query

Import is useful when data is below or equal to 1 GB and want to load the data directly in PowerBI

Direct Query is useful when the data is more that 1 GB and can not be loaded in the PowerBI , so it is used directly from server.
