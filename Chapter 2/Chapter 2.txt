🧠 Step 1: Data Understanding
Before visualizing, it’s crucial to understand and assess your dataset.

✅ Example Datasets Used in This Chapter:
Basic Food Delivery App Data
➤ A simple Excel file.

Detailed Food Delivery Data
➤ An Excel file containing:

Food name

Who ordered it

Member type

Restaurant details, etc.
🔹 Note: This dataset is already normalized, so no normalization is needed.

🔍 What to Check in This Step:
Null or blank values

Missing records

Data type mismatches (e.g., numbers stored as text)

Text inconsistencies (e.g., capitalization)

Correct column headers

🔄 Step 2: Data Transformation Using ETL (Power Query)
Power BI includes Power Query, a built-in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool that lets you:

Clean data

Format columns

Apply filters and transformations dynamically

🔔 Important Note:
If no data cleaning is needed, you can directly Load the data.

If data needs checking or cleaning, click Transform Data to open Power Query and perform ETL operations.
